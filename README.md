As you wish to use the website platform, please follow the instruction below: 
1. Simply sign in with your Hanover email account and password. 

2. Select the building you want to find out coming/current events.

3. Sign up for any event in which you are interested or Simply check for the events are coming up.

4. Select your coming events checkbox for tracking of your own events/classes, including what building and rooms are.

5. You can also search for Hanover College students/staffs/offices by name or Hanover College email for at which building their offices are, their Hanover phone number, and if they are avaiable to meet or not.

You can also create an event on to the database, sit back and waiting for people to come over and hangout.
